// should I add it to my resume?

// oh I also solved 5kyu question on codewars with it

// I was just playing with my locations on twitter
// and I found something really weird
// you can basically change your location to any square color 
// but only blue!!!! why is that @twitter
// I just wanted to add typescript to my list of tech I know here
// then twitter told me I can't use the emoji lol

// whenever a user follows me, my twitter photo will change to his photo 
// in no time .. go and try it out
